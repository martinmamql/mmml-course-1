### Course format

Lectures will be performed Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3:20pm. Each lecture will focus on a specific
mathematical concept related to multimodal machine learning. These lectures will be given by the
course instructor, a guest lecturer or a TA.

**Canvas:** We will use CMU Canvas as a central hub for the course. From Canvas, you can access the
links to the live lectures (using Zoom). You can also connect to our course discussion platform
Piazza (see more details below) and the grading platform Gradescope directly from Canvas.
Quizzes will be done using Canvas as well.

**Zoom:** We will use the Zoom video platform for the live lectures on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Links
to the live lectures will be available on Canvas. The lectures will also be recorded to allow students
to watch them again later on. 

**Piazza:** We will be using Piazza for class communication and announcement. The system is highly
catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TAs and the instructor. Rather
than emailing questions to the teaching staff, you are encouraged to post your questions on
Piazza. You can post privately to the instructor and TAs through Piazza website. Piazza can be
accessed from the course Canvas page, or directly at this URL:

[https://piazza.com/cmu/fall2020/11777/home](https://piazza.com/cmu/fall2020/11777/home){:target="\_blank"}

**Gradescope:** Students are asked to submit their project assignments through the website
Gradescope. This platform will be used for grading and to handle any request for re-grading.
Gradescope can be access from the course Canvas page.

### Course Material
