### Course format

Lectures will be performed Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3:20pm. Each lecture will focus on a specific
mathematical concept related to multimodal machine learning. These lectures will be given by the
course instructor, a guest lecturer or a TA.

**Canvas:** We will use CMU Canvas as a central hub for the course. From Canvas, you can access the
links to the live lectures (using Zoom). You can also connect to our course discussion platform
Piazza (see more details below) and the grading platform Gradescope directly from Canvas.
Quizzes will be done using Canvas as well.

**Zoom:** We will use the Zoom video platform for the live lectures on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Links
to the live lectures will be available on Canvas. The lectures will also be recorded to allow students
to watch them again later on. 

**Piazza:** We will be using Piazza for class communication and announcement. The system is highly
catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TAs and the instructor. Rather
than emailing questions to the teaching staff, you are encouraged to post your questions on
Piazza. You can post privately to the instructor and TAs through Piazza website. Piazza can be
accessed from the course Canvas page, or directly at this URL:

[https://piazza.com/cmu/fall2020/11777/home](https://piazza.com/cmu/fall2020/11777/home){:target="\_blank"}

**Gradescope:** Students are asked to submit their project assignments through the website
Gradescope. This platform will be used for grading and to handle any request for re-grading.
Gradescope can be access from the course Canvas page.

### Course Material

**Required:**
- Reading material will be based on published technical papers available via the
ACM/IEEE/Springer digital libraries or freely available online (e.g., arxiv.org). All CMU students
have already free access to these digital archives.
- For project assignments, previous experience in Python programming is expected

### Course Topics

### Project Assignments and Timeline

(See Piazza for additional information)
• **Dataset preferences** (Due on Tuesday 9/8 at 11:59pm ET) – Let us know your preferences for
the datasets that you would like to use for the course project. This will help with the team
matching process.
• **Project Pre-proposal** (Due on Wednesday 9/16 at 11:59pm ET) – You should have selected
your teammates, dataset, and task. Submit a 1-page pre-proposal plan.
• **First assignment** (Due on Sunday 10/11 at 11:59pm ET) – This assignment focuses on unimodal
representations and requires a good literature review on the topic of your proposed project
• **Midterm assignment** (Due on Sunday 11/14 at 11:59pm ET) – Students are asked to
implement and evaluate state-of-the-art baseline models on their project dataset.
• **Final assignment** (Due on Sunday 12/13 at 11:59pm ET) – Students should explore new ideas
to model their multimodal research project.

### Grading

#### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I
encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as
possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you
suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet
registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at 
[access@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:access@andrew.cmu.edu){:target="\_blank"}.

#### Statement on Student Wellness

As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as
strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating
and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your
academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. CMU services
are available, and treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health
services available on campus at: [http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/](http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/){:target="\_blank"}.
Support is always available (24/7) from Counseling and Psychological Services: 412-268-2922.
