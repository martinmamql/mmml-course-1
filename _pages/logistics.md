### Course format

Lectures will be performed Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3:20pm. Each lecture will focus on a specific
mathematical concept related to multimodal machine learning. These lectures will be given by the
course instructor, a guest lecturer or a TA.

**Canvas:** We will use CMU Canvas as a central hub for the course. From Canvas, you can access the
links to the live lectures (using Zoom). You can also connect to our course discussion platform
Piazza (see more details below) and the grading platform Gradescope directly from Canvas.
Quizzes will be done using Canvas as well.

**Zoom:** We will use the Zoom video platform for the live lectures on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Links
to the live lectures will be available on Canvas. The lectures will also be recorded to allow students
to watch them again later on. 

**Piazza:** We will be using Piazza for class communication and announcement. The system is highly
catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TAs and the instructor. Rather
than emailing questions to the teaching staff, you are encouraged to post your questions on
Piazza. You can post privately to the instructor and TAs through Piazza website. Piazza can be
accessed from the course Canvas page, or directly at this URL:

[https://piazza.com/cmu/fall2020/11777/home](https://piazza.com/cmu/fall2020/11777/home)

**Gradescope:** Students are asked to submit their project assignments through the website
Gradescope. This platform will be used for grading and to handle any request for re-grading.
Gradescope can be access from the course Canvas page.

### Course Topics

### Project Assignments and Timeline

(See Piazza for additional information)
- **Dataset preferences** (Due on Tuesday 9/8 at 11:59pm ET) – Let us know your preferences for
the datasets that you would like to use for the course project. This will help with the team
matching process.
- **Project Pre-proposal** (Due on Wednesday 9/16 at 11:59pm ET) – You should have selected
your teammates, dataset, and task. Submit a 1-page pre-proposal plan.
- **First assignment** (Due on Sunday 10/11 at 11:59pm ET) – This assignment focuses on unimodal
representations and requires a good literature review on the topic of your proposed project
- **Midterm assignment** (Due on Sunday 11/14 at 11:59pm ET) – Students are asked to
implement and evaluate state-of-the-art baseline models on their project dataset.
- **Final assignment** (Due on Sunday 12/13 at 11:59pm ET) – Students should explore new ideas
to model their multimodal research project.

### Grading

- Grading breakdown
  - Lecture participation and mini-quizzes 15%
  - Reading assignments and question sets 15%
  - Course project assignments:
    - Project preferences and pre-proposal 5%
    - First project assignment and presentation 15%
    - Mid-term project assignment and presentation 20%
    - Final project assignment and presentation 30%
- Lecture participation and mini-quizzes
  - Lectures can be attended live (using Zoom) or watched later. Students are encouraged
to attend lectures live as often as possible, to allow them to ask clarification questions,
if needed. Questions can also be posted on Piazza.
  - Mini-quizzes are designed to be relatively simple. If students took the time to watch
both weekly lectures, it should be easy for them to answer the questions. It should be
noted that simply reading the slide document is not considered sufficient. Students are
expected to watch all lectures (live or recorded).
  - These weekly mini-quizzes will be usually (but not always) released after the Thursday
lecture and students will have 48 hours to complete them. No mini-quizzes are
expected for weeks when a project assignment (first, midterm or final) is due. No miniquiz during the first week and during Thanksgiving week.
    - We expect 10 mini-quizzes this semester.
  - Each mini-quiz is worth 1.5 points, for a total of 15 points.
- Reading assignments and question sets
  - Reading assignments are designed to complement the lectures and showcase recent
state-of-the-art research. Most reading assignments will consist of 2 research papers,
sometime accompanied of optional readings, and a set of 2 or 3 questions. The
questions are designed to help you think about the concepts expressed in the papers. 
  - The expectation is that you answer 2 out of 3 questions (or 1 out of 2 questions if
there is only one paper that week). Each answer should be about 1 long paragraph (6-8
lines). All you answered should be submitted together before Monday 8pm ET on
Gradescope.
  - Reading assignments will be per released weekly, with exceptions when a project
assignment (first, midterm or final) is due the same week. Also, no reading
assignments during the first week and during Thanksgiving week.
    - We expect students to read approximately 15 research papers, as part of the
10 reading assignments this semester.
  - Each reading assignment is worth 2 point when two papers are included, or 1 point
when only one paper is included. In other words:
    - If the question set was designed for two research papers, then your combined
answers will be worth two points.
    - If the question set was designed for only one research paper, then your
answer will be wort one point.
- Course project:
  - The goal of the course project is to experiment with state-of-the-art multimodal
algorithms and computational models.
  - Students should create teams between 3 to 5 students preferably (special approval will
be required for larger teams; no smaller teams will be allowed). The size and depth of
the project should be adjusted to reflect the size of the team.
  - Each team is required to create a code repository (github) for their project. All project
members should be included in this project and should actively use it. It is important
that all team members participate equally to the project. The first project assignment
and follow-up reports (midterm and final reports) will need to outline the tasks of each
student. If any team member has concern in the participation level of other members,
they should contact the instructor and/or TA as promptly as possible.
  - Students have flexibility in the selection of their project topic. The project should be
directly aligned with the course content and include at the minimum two modalities.
At the beginning of the semester, the instructor will propose a set of research
problems and datasets which can be used for the course projects.
  - Pre-proposal: We ask students to prepare a pre-proposal early in the semester to
them establish their research topic for the course project. The pre-proposal will also
help with team formation, in the rare eventuality when students are still looking for
teammates.
  - First project assignment: The first project assignment consists of a written report and
an oral presentation (which will be performed remotely, with pre-recorded videos).
This assignment has two main goals: describe in more details the plan for the course
project (aka., “proposal”) and perform some unimodal analyses on the multimodal
dataset and problem. Feedback will be given by instructors as well as other students
from the course.
  - Midterm project assignment: The midterm project assignment is designed to
implement multimodal baseline models and perform some error analysis on these
results. This assignment also has two components: written report and oral
presentation. By the submission time for the midterm assignment, students should
have already implemented some of the state-of-the-art baseline models for their
selected multimodal task and dataset.
  - Final project assignment: Using the same dataset and task selected for the midterm
report, the final project assignment is designed to explore new research ideas. This
assignment is not graded based on the quality of the results, but instead on the
exploration of new ideas (e.g., better accuracy results will not mean better course
grade). Students are encouraged to explore new research directions. The final project
assignment also contains written and oral components.

#### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I
encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as
possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you
suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet
registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at 
[access@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:access@andrew.cmu.edu).

#### Statement on Student Wellness

As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as
strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating
and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your
academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. CMU services
are available, and treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health
services available on campus at: [http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/](http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/).
Support is always available (24/7) from Counseling and Psychological Services: 412-268-2922.
